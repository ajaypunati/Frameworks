SPRING INTRODUCTION:-
=====================

WHAT IS SPRING..?
=======================
-->Spring is an open source java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust java applications very easily.
-->Spring  was intially written by "Rod Jhonson" in the year june 2003.
-->Current Spring version is 6.2.0.
->Spring offers features like,
   -->dependency Injection,
   -->Aspect Oriented Programming
   -->Transaction Management
-->Spring Key Modules Include:
     -->Spring MVC for Web Application Development
     -->Spring Boot for rapid Application Development


WHY WE NEED TO LEARN SPRING..?
===============================
-->Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise java.
-->Spring framework aims to make J2EE developmenet easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling POJO-based programming models.

INVERSION OF CONTROL(IOC):-

DEPENDENCY INJECTION(DI):-
--------------------------
-->A Technique where the Dependencies of an object are Injected by the IOC container, promoting loose copuling and Modualrity.

BEANS:-
-------
-->Beans are nothing but Objects Managed by the Spring Container.
-->They are Configured through XML, Annotations or java code.

ApplicationContext:-
---------------------
-->It is an Interface Representing the Spring IOC Container, responsible for Instatiating, configuring and Managing Beans.
