SPRING INTRODUCTION:-
=====================
"WHAT IS SPRING..?"
=======================
-->Spring is an open source java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust java applications very easily.
-->Spring  was intially written by "Rod Jhonson" in the year june 2003.
-->Current Spring version is 6.2.7.
->Spring offers features like,
   -->dependency Injection,
   -->Aspect Oriented Programming
   -->Transaction Management
-->Spring Key Modules Include:
     -->Spring MVC for Web Application Development
     -->Spring Boot for rapid Application Development

"WHAT IS FRAMEWORK..?"
======================
-->Instead of Developing Everything from scratch , java is providing some jar files, those jar files are called as Framework.


"WHY WE NEED TO LEARN SPRING..?"
================================
-->Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise java.
-->Spring framework aims to make J2EE developmenet easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling POJO-based programming models.
-->Spring is light weight when it comes to size and transparency.
-->Spring enables loose coupling, easily testable and also helps in developing highly performing Applications.
-->Any IT Application can be developed by using Spring and Spring boot.
-->It makes Developer life easier.

SPRING CORE:-
--------------
-->Spring Core is a Foundational Module of Spring Framework providing Essential Functionalities such as Inversion of Control(IOC) and Dependency Injection(DI).


"SPRING INVERSION OF CONTROL(IOC):-"
----------------------------------
-->A Design Principle where the control of object creation and dependencies is transferred to a container(i.e jar file)rather than being managed directly by the Application
  code.

"SPRING DEPENDENCY INJECTION(DI):-"
-----------------------------------
-->It is a flavour of IOC.
-->A Technique where the Dependencies of an object are Injected by the IOC container, promoting loose copuling and Modualrity.
-->Dependency Injection helps in gluing the classes together and at the same time keeping them Independent.
-->Dependency Injection can happen in the way of passing parameters to the constructor or by post-construction using setter methods.
-->Dependency Injection is a heart of Spring framework.


"SPRING SETTER INJECTION  VS  CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION"
====================================================
ASPECT:-
--------
1)Injection Method:-
  -->Dependencies are Provided through "Setter Methods".
  -->Dependencies are Provided through the class "Constructor".

2)Type of Dependency:-
    -->Used for "Optional" Dependencies.
    -->Used for "Mandatory" Dependencies.

3)Object State:-
    -->Creates "mutable" objects; Dependencies can be changed Later.
    -->Creates "Immutable" Objects; since all dependencies are fixed at creation.

4)Circular Dependencies:-
     -->"Easier" to handle Circular Dependencies.
     -->"Difficult to handle Circular Dependencies.

5)Recommended Usage:-
    -->Recommended for optional dependencies.
    -->Recommended by Spring as the default approach for core requried dependencies.

-->Constructor Injection is the best option when compared to the setter Injection because in Constructor Injection there will be "Easy Data Loading" when compare to the Setter Injection.



BEANS:-
-------
-->Beans are nothing but Objects Managed by the Spring Container.
-->They are Configured through XML, Annotations or java code.

ApplicationContext:-
---------------------
-->It is an Interface Representing the Spring IOC Container, responsible for Instatiating, configuring and Managing Beans.

"SPRING CORE MODULES:-"
=======================
-->The spring core consists of several modules they are:
 1)Core :- Provides fundamental functionalities and base classes.
 2)Beans :- Handles bean definition, creation and management.
 3)Context :- Offering an Application Context for managing beans in a more enterprise friendly way.
 4)Expression Language(SpEL):- A Powerful Expression Language used for querying and manipulating objects at run time.


"SPRING BEAN LIFE CYCLE:-"
==========================
-->We have six phases in Spring bean life cycle they are:-
    -->Instantiation
    -->Population of properties
    -->Aware Interfaces.
    -->Initialization
    -->Ready for use
    -->Destruction

 1)Instantiation:- 
 ------------------
 -->The Spring Container Creates an Instance of the bean using it's Constructor.

2)Population of Properties:-
----------------------------
-->Spring injects dependencies and set Properties of the bean using setter injection, constructor injection or filed injection.

3)Aware Interfaces:-
--------------------
-->If the bean implements spring's Aware Interfaces(BeanNameAware, BeanFactoryAware, ApplicationContextAware),then spring invokes corresponding call back methods.

4)Initialization:-
-------------------
-->If a custom Initialization method is configured(via @PostConstruct or init-method attribute in XML configuration), Spring calls the Specified Method.

5)Read for use:-
------------------
-->The  bean is completely or fully initialized and available for use by the Applicaton.

6)Destruction:-
---------------
-->If a customized Destruction method is configured(via @PreDestroy annotation or destroy-method attribute in XML configuration), spring calls the specified method.


"SPRING BEAN SCOPES:-"
=====================
-->Spring bean scopes define the lifecycle and visibility of a bean within the spring  Container. There are five main scopes they are:
  1)SingleTon:- Only one Instance of the bean is created per Spring IOC Container. This is the default Scope.
  2)Prototype:- A new Instance of the bean is created every time it is requested.
  3)Request:- A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP Request. This scope is only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
  4)Session:- A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP Session. This scope is only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
  5)Global-Session:- A new instance of the bean is created for each Global HTTP Session. This scope is only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring
    ApplicationContext.


"WHY WE NEED MAVEN..?"
=====================
-->Instead of, We downloading and installing jar files manually, the maven build tool will help in donwloading and installing jar files automatically in a
   easiest way.

"WHAT IS MAVEN..?"
================
-->Maven is an Automactic Build tool which helps in downloading and installing executable jar files automatically in a easiest way in to Local Repository
   from Remote Repository.
  eg:-  (local Repo<----Pom.xml<--Remote Repo(Maven))


"Spring MVC and Architecture:-"
===============================
-->Spring MVC is a framework for building Web Applications in java.
-->It is based on Model-View-Control Design Pattern.
-->It leverages features of the core Spring frameworks such as Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection.


"Architectural Diagram of Spring MVC:-"
=======================================

  Request --> Dispatcher Servlet(Front Controller) --> Handler Mapping--> Controller
                       |<---------(ModelandView obj)--------------------------|
                     |
                     |
               View Resolver  --> View 

1)Browser Will send Request to the Server. Server will take that Request, Proccess it and send it to the Front Controller.

2)Front Controller is nothing but a Dispatcher Servlet, its job is to send that Request to the Appropiate Servlet.

3)Controller Code is the one Written by Developers, which contains the Bussiness Logic.

4)Controller will Prepare the Model and send that Model to the FrontController for further Processing.

5)Front Controller then sends that model Object to the View Template, Which Contains the HTMl Code and data which needs to be displayed on the Web page.
